# mcu_cloud
Effort to connect a microcontroller to the cloud using Ethernet and (possibly) AWS. I will use C++ in this project to understand how it can be used in embedded systems. 

Microcontroller: TI Tiva TM4C129NCPDTI Evaluation Kit
IDE: Code Composer Studio (CCS)
Development Language: C++ (TivaWare libraries are in C)
